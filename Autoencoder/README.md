# Autoencoder and Denoising Autoencoder using TensorFlow/Keras
This repository contains implementations of a basic Autoencoder and a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) using TensorFlow/Keras. The models are trained on the MNIST dataset to learn efficient representations of handwritten digits and to reconstruct images from noisy inputs.

Features

Implements a basic autoencoder to reconstruct images.

Implements a denoising autoencoder that learns to remove noise from corrupted images.

Uses fully connected (dense) layers for encoding and decoding.

Trains models on the MNIST dataset.

Visualizes original, noisy, and reconstructed images.
